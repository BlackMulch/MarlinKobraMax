# Kobra Max Updated Firmware
I've been working to bring the latest Marlin to the Kobra Max, the project is in active development and I didn't test everything yet.

# Please note
### What is Working:
- Automatic Bed Leveling
- LCD Screen
- Printing Fine
- Settings Working
- Can be built with Platformio and Vs Code

### What is not Working
- Filament Sensor
- Power Loss Recovery
- Nozzle Light
- You Tell me

# Warning
Unfortunately I cannot give any promises or guarantees, I just have my one printer to try things on, so I cannot test for any other circumstances or variables. Which means that you are fully responsible for what happens when using this firmware.
